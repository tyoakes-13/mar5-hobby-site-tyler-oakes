Queen is a band that I think will always stay relevant. I can remember listening to their music during long car rides with my family, especially listening to Bohemian Rhapsody. The songs makes me think of happy times and being with family. Another one of my favourite songs by Queen is Fat Bottomed Girls, specifically because I like the line "get on your bikes and ride". Again this line takes me back to my childhood because my dad would always yell that line really loud. A third song that I really like is "Somebody to Love" because it reminds of my favourite movie Ella Enchanted.
