  Guns N' Roses Slash Guitar Jimi Hendrix Sweet Child Of Mine Band Paradise City
  Welcome to the Jungle Favourite
---
One of my favourite bands as a child was Guns N' Roses. As a baby, one of the few songs that would stop me from crying was Paradise City, so my parents used to play it all the time. I think that is part of the reason I still enjoy their music to this day. I also really enjoy Slash's ability to play the guitar, as he is incredibly talented and I would consider him one of the best guitar players of all time along with Jimi Hendrix. As a child I wanted to learn how to play the guitar like Slash because I was so amazed by his ability. My three favourite songs by Guns N' Roses to this day are Sweet Child of Mine, Paradise City, and Welcome to the Jungle.
