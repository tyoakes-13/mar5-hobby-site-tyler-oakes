Rock and Roll music first started coming out during the 1950's and transformed into different styles throught those years and into the 1960's. It was very popular amongst teenagers as a sign of rebellion against their parents because a lot of the lyrics were against popular religious beliefs. I grew up listening to rock and roll, as did my parents, so it is something that I am quite passionate about. My favourite sub-genre of rock is classic rock because I love the unique sound of it and the flow of the lyrics.
