  ACDC Music Thunderstruck Hells Bells Classic Rock Concert Awesome Rock Band
  Hockey Tournament

One of my favourite Rock bands is ACDC. I have always wanted to go to an ACDC concert because I think they would be awesome to see in concert. One fond memory I have of their music is palying their song called Thunderstruck before all of my hockey games. Before hockey tournaments we would always listen to a playlist of just ACDC music because their songs are great for getting ready for a hockey game. My favourite album from them is Highway to hell because they have a few songs that I really enjoy. I hope that one day I am able to attend at least one ACDC concert.
