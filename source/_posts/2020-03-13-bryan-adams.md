  Bryan Adams Summer of 69 Music Rock Concert Taylor Swift Song Surprise
  Favourite

While Bryan Adams is not one of my favourite rock music artists, he did create my favourite song, which is Summer of 69. It is my favourite song because the lyrics are easy to remember and sing along to and I enjoy how the song is like a story. A couple of years ago I went to a Taylor Swift concert with my girlfriend and Taylor Swift surprised the audience by bringing out Bryan Adams to sing Summer of 69. It was a great surprise for me as they both did a duet of my favourite song, and I never expected to be able to hear the song live. I will remember this moment for the rest of my life. It was my favourite part of the concert because it was a huge surprise.
